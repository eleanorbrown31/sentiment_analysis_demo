    - We start with labelled training data (examples of positive and negative text)
    - The model learns patterns from this data during training
    - With each epoch, the model's accuracy typically improves
    - The trained model can then analyse new text it hasn't seen before
    - The model gives both a prediction and confidence score
    - **Feedback loop:** When predictions are wrong, you can correct them
    - **Model improvement:** Corrections are added to training data to improve future predictions
    - **Continuous learning:** Retrain the model with the expanded dataset to improve accuracy
